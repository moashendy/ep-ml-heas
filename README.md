# Machine Learning for High-Entropy Alloys (HEAs)

This project uses First-Principles data to predict the thermophysical 
properties of alloys using Machine Learning.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed simulation data.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data processing and training.
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory Data Analysis and model experiments.
